SUMMARY
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program attempted to implement breadth-first search for the sliding
brick puzzle. DFS and IDS were NOT implemented.
This program could only solve LEVEL 0 problems with BFS. It seemed to run in an
infinite loop at LEVEL 1.
This program DOES NOT print the path to the solution.

HOW TO RUN

Run using: "make", "make HW1", or "make target=inputFile" where inputFile is
a file with the values for a game state.

If a input file is not specified the program will prompt the user for one.

The program will then print the game state and run BFS on it. It print the
solved state if the puzzle is solved.

BUGS/ERRORS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This program falls short of the directions in the assignment. I have
pointed out its shortcomings in order to save the grader's time.

Along with the correct implementation of the BFS, DFS, and IDS other
improvements would include using lists instead of vectors in C++ for
constant time insert and erase.
